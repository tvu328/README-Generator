# README Generator

## Description
This README generator was made to be accessible and covenient to project creators. It allows them to dedicate more time on the project rather than working on a README file. 

# Installation
Steps to install this project starts with installing inquirer using npm i inquirer@8.2.4. Then running node index.js in the command line. When running that command, you will be prompted with various questions that are normal sections in a README file. Sections such as the description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contribution, tests, and questions will be prompted to user when running node index.js and will find their README file generated and filled out with what was answered to each prompt. A choice of using a license or not is also prompted with common licenses to choose from. Finally, node index.js will prompt the user with their Github username and email address to allow others to reach out for any additional questions or concerns.
